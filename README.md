# Exercises!

## Squash me!

Checkout branch `feature/squash-me`.

Look at the latest commit history. What a mess! Those latest commits all revolve around a single change, and could have been a single commit.

Squash the commits into a single atomic commit.

Don't forget to push!

## Rebase me!

Checkout branch `feature/rebase-me-with-dev`.

Oh no! This branch has diverged from `develop` and now there's a conflict!

No worries! We can *rebase* `feature/rebase-me-with-dev` onto `develop` to clean this up.

Rebase `feature/rebase-me-with-dev` onto the latest version of `develop`. 

Don't forget to push!
